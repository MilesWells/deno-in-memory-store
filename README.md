Quick and easy Deno document based in memory store. For my own practice with
Deno features and as a stupid-simple BE for building quick UI PoC with reactive

Run with `./scripts/run.sh`

#### Features

1. Data persistance and reloading on start and exit
1. Simple API to add documents

That's all you get
